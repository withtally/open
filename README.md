# Governance Frontend powered by Tally

Welcome to the Governance Frontend powered by Tally, an open source project that aims to make decentralized governance more accessible and efficient. This repository hosts a Next.js application written in TypeScript that interfaces with Tally's API to provide comprehensive governance functionalities.

## Overview

Decentralization is at the heart of blockchain and DeFi projects, fostering an environment that is transparent, secure, and resistant to censorship. This project is designed to enhance the power of decentralized governance, by providing an easy-to-use, self-hostable frontend to interact with Tally's decentralized governance tool. 

The application is designed to be easy to integrate and customize, allowing you to host it on your own website and tailor it to your needs. This empowers you to establish and manage your own governance system, promoting democratic decision-making and community participation. 

Please note, this project is still in development and will be available soon.

## Tech Stack

This project uses Next.js, a popular React framework, and TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript. By using these technologies, we aim to create a robust, scalable, and maintainable codebase.

## Requirements

To run this application, you will need:

- Node.js
- Yarn or npm (Yarn is preferred)
- A Tally API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-github-handle/governance-frontend-tally.git
cd governance-frontend-tally
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Or if you are using npm:

```
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file at the root of the project and add your Tally API key:

```
TALLY_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

## Running the Application

You can start the application using the following command:

```
yarn dev
```

Or if you are using npm:

```
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
